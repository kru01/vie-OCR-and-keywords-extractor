# Vietnamese OCR And Keywords Extractor

Live preview: https://vie-ocr-keywords-extractor.herokuapp.com/

## What is this?

This is a website that extracts Vietnamese texts and keywords from uploaded photos.
- We made this as part of our final project for the HCMUS' 2021 Introduction to IT course.

## Usage

Upload an image and click Convert. The length of your text determines how long you have to wait for this thing to work, or it might just crash altogether.
- I would recommend choosing images with less than 100 words, e.g, only a specific part of your text instead of the whole thing.
- The website is very **buggy** (mostly because I have no idea how to develop in Node.js) so please don't spam it :pray:.
- I will comeback to fix this eventually (hopefully) :wave:.
